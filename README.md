# TestDrivenDevelopment-JAVA

## Training Test Driven Development in Java for Alten Nederland

This course is based on the video 'Dive into TDD' made by Jon Dickinson (CodeKen). [Here is a link to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIWLC3dexSA). You are free to follow along woth Jon's video and complete this course! The video explains it very clearly step by step how to get started with TDD by taking a dive into it. 

For classroom training purposes Eric de Graaf (Alten Nederland) has written out all the exercises in a document and included the solution sources in this repository. These materials are very helpful in our training classes for TDD.
